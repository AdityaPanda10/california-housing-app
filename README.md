# california-housing-app
A machine learning web app that predicts California housing prices using Linear &amp; Logistic Regression. Built with Streamlit and deployed for live testing. Includes visualizations and user input features.
# California Housing Price Prediction App

## 📋 **Project Description**

This is a **machine learning web application** built using **Streamlit** that predicts **California housing prices** based on user inputs. The app uses two machine learning algorithms:
- **Linear Regression** to predict exact housing prices.
- **Logistic Regression** to classify housing prices into three categories: Low, Medium, and High.

### **Features:**
- Predict housing prices based on factors like **median income**, **house age**, and **number of rooms**.
- **Interactive visualizations** for better understanding of the data.
- User-friendly interface with real-time predictions.

## 💻 **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (Programming Language)
- **Streamlit** (Web Framework)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Pandas** (Data Processing)
- **NumPy** (Scientific Computing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)
